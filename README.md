# Project Overview
Trayko is a lightweight browser extension that rewards users with badges for discovering internet easter eggs. It runs quietly in the background, detects supported pages and events, and updates the user’s badge collection in real time. The goal is to create a simple and fun way to explore the web while keeping the experience fast and unobtrusive.

# What It Does
Trayko tracks when a user visits specific pages or triggers certain actions and unlocks badges based on those interactions. The extension includes a clean popup interface, organized badge icons and a smooth user experience designed for quick access and minimal distraction.

# Tech Stack
Trayko is built with JavaScript and HTML. The project includes a background script for event handling, a popup interface for badge viewing and a structured manifest for browser compatibility.

# Project Status
This project is actively being improved as new badge ideas and easter eggs are added. Feedback and contributions are welcome.
